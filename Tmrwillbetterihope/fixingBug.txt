NGON
(write receipts toString for displaying Product's data
should have Time create receipts, receipts code
and access to hashmap print this too product code: quantity 
and important part, i'm using netbean 8.2, is there anyway to make the some line in output more outstanding than others one(not using anther language like html), if possible, you adjust receipts toString to have 1 parameter product code, and at that product code line, make it outstanding. but if it impossible to make, it fine)
